## R & RStudio

These pages of the documentation are meant for researchers, educators, data analysts, students and other who are working with the open source programs R and RStudio or intend to. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows you to use R in an interactive (and graphical) way, write your scripts/code and manage your work space. R and Rstudio are available as dedicated work spaces (servers) that can be requested using this [form](**[ADD URL TO TOP DESK FORM HERE]**).

## Cloud server for RStudio

Within the Hogeschool Utrecht we offer the use of R & RStudio through pre-installed version of the RStudio on a server. This RStudio Server runs on a remote UBUNTU 18.04 Linux server and has already a number of R packages that are generally needed for data analysis tasks installed. You can login to a server on a dedicated web address and with the credentials supplied by the helpdesk if you apply for an account. The advantage of cloud servers is that you do not need to install any additional software on your own laptops.

## Logging into the server

When you apply for an R/RStudio Server work space via the application [form](**[ADD URL TO TOP DESK FORM HERE]**), you will get a web address (url) and log in credentials. 

The url will look something like this:

`https://datascience.hu.nl/rstudio/project-name`

The `project-name` part of the url is the name for your research project or course name that you chose when applied for the workspace. If you cannot remember your workspace url or you have different question you can always sent an email to the cloud developer team of the HU via [HU onderzoeksupport](mailto:onderzoeksupport@hu.nl) 

When you access the url of the workspace you will see the following login screen:

After logging into the server with your user name and password you will enter the RStudio Software which shows a typical layout like this:

## Using R & RStudio
To get started from here to use R and RStudio to do amazing things regarding data analysis, visualization, data cleaning and selection. To do statitistical analysis or to run machine learning and other AI experiments start with
