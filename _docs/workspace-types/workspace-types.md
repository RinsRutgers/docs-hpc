On this page you will find the different types of work spaces that are
currently available to perform tasks on:

-   data analysis
-   data cleaning
-   visualization
-   reporting
-   exploratory data anlysis
-   inference
-   machine learning
-   deep learning
-   teaching Data Science and Statistics

Work space types - READY
------------------------

Currently we have the following works paces available:

1.  **Jupyter-Hub Notebooks** (short: Jupyter). This work space is meant
    for analysis of data using Python and R in Jupyter Notebooks. This
    work space comes with Python and R installations and can also be
    used to run Bash scripts via the Linux Terminal, also available in
    the work space. When requesting the work space, you can specify the
    required Python Libraries in a requirements.txt file in a Github
    repo. The Jupyter work spaces run standard on CPUs in the cluster.
    We are currently investigating whether we can also deploy these work
    spaces on GPUs.

For more details and how to get started see
[Jupyterhub](/docs/jupyterhub/index/)

1.  **RStudio Server** (short: RStudio). This workspace is primarily
    meant for people who want to use RStudio for their Data Science
    tasks. This workspace comes with an aninstallation of latest R
    version and can be extended for other programming languages such as
    Python, SQL, Stan, C++, D3. RStudio comes with RMarkdown, a literate
    programming platform, based on LaTeX that enables publication of
    data analysis products, directly from RStudio to several output
    formats such as html, Word, PowerPoint, pdf, slide-shows etc and
    even complete books and blogs. Rstudio is especially recommended to
    people who would like to have a one-stop environment for performing
    Data Science.
