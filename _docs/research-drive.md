You can request to have a `research-drive` folder in your user's home directory. You can then mount this folder to your personal research drive using your credentials. The credentials must be generated from your research drive's setting page under *Security -> WebDAV passwords*. You can save your credentials in the private file `~/.davfs2/secrets` in your home directory.
