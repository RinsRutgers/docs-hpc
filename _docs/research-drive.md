## Connecting from your workspace to data in HU ResearchDrive

The HU ResearchDrive storage facility provided to the HU through SURF can be attached to your online workspace. This enables easy acces to your data in HU ResearchDrive from your online analysis workspace and prevents generating multiple copies of the the data. The data is not actually copied to the workspace but a link to the data-store is created by mounting the folder into the workspace. Data containing personal information under GDPR restriction can in this way be accessed and anlysed in your workspace.   

You can request the admin [mailto:](onderzoeksupport@hu.nl) to setup a `research-drive` folder in the home directory of your workspace . You can then mount this folder to your personal research drive using your credentials. 

Go to https://hu.data.surfsara.nl/ to login to your HU ResearchDrive environment.  

The credentials must be generated from your research drive's setting page under Generate a WebDav password from `Settings` -> `Security` -> `WebDAV passwords`. You can save your credentials in the private file `~/.davfs2/secrets` in your workspace home directory.
