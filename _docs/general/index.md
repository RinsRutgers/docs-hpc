## Purpose

The research cloud provides data analysis workspaces for academic courses and research projects at Hogeschool Utrecht. Its goal is to facilitate education in courses that require collaborative programing and complex data analysis. In addition, it aims to ease access  to increased computational power for researchers, most of which are limited by what their personal machine can offer.

## Applying for a Workspace

If you would like to get a workspace on the HU Research Cloud you can apply for one [here](https://askhu.sharepoint.hu.nl/informatie-items/Paginas/Data-analyse-omgeving-aanvragen.aspx).

## Connecting to a Workspace

You can access a workspace using this addressing scheme `https://datascience.hu.nl/{workspace_type}/{project_name}`. For example, the URL for a `Jupyter` workspace running the project `addb-pm` is `https://datascience.hu.nl/jupyter/addb-pm`.
