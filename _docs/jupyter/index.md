This work space is meant for analysis of data using Python and R in Jupyter Notebooks. This work space comes with Python and R installations and can also be used to run Bash scripts via the Linux Terminal, also available in the work space. When requesting the work space, you can specify the required Python Libraries in a requirements.txt file in a Github repo. The Jupyter work spaces run standard on CPUs in the cluster. We are currently investigating whether we can also deploy these work spaces on GPUs.
