## Jupyter user

When you access your workspace for the first time, you will need to sign up
with a username and password. The admin of the workspace will then need to authorize
your account in order to sign in.

## Jupyter admin

When you sign up with your admin username for the first time, the password that you use will
be the new password of your account. You can then sign in with those credentials to your workspace.

### Authorize users

In order to authorize new users to sign in, navigate to `https://datascience.hu.nl/jupyter/{project_name}/hub/authorize`
and select `authorize` next to the username.
